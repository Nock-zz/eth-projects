As global setup you must update git to get the user name (per github) and email address (per github)
>git config --global user.email "nick.morter@gmail.com"
>git config --global user.name "Nock-zz"

To make a project available for git - run git init to initialise git for the project
>git init

Create a repository in github.com (in this example es6-babel-webpack)
Then associate the local directory with this repository.
>git remote add origin https://github.com/Nock-zz/es6-babel-webpack.git


Create some file
>echo "# es6-babel-webpack" >> README.md
Check what is missing from git with:
>git status

Then add this file to git. To add all files and sub-directories:
>git add .
or just the file
>git add README.md

Now we must commit the changes with a message of "first commit"
>git commit -m "first commit"

Now we can push the changes to the origin (github es6-babel-webpack repo) and the branch (master)
The -u is to denote that origin is upstream and therefore the ultimate source of truth.
It only needs to be set once.
>git push -u origin master

and later changes can be pushed to github with:
>git push

Now the github repository will be in synch with the local one.
